We are extremely delighted to release COMET. COMET/Flux is a communication-overlapping library for dense/MoE models on GPUs, providing high-performance and pluggable kernels to support various parallelisms in model training/inference.

Flux's efficient kernels are compatible with Pytorch and can be integrated into existing frameworks easily, supporting various Nvidia GPU architectures and data types.

Welcome to join the [Wechat](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d3fcb3bf-466b-4efe-8c3f-5f85258202ae) group and stay tuned!
