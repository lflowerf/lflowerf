We are extremely delighted to release COMET. COMET/Flux is a communication-overlapping library for dense/MoE models on GPUs, providing high-performance and pluggable kernels to support various parallelisms in model training/inference.

Flux's efficient kernels are compatible with Pytorch and can be integrated into existing frameworks easily, supporting various Nvidia GPU architectures and data types.
